A unite.vim (vimscript #3396) source that displays Vims spelling suggestions for a word, updating live as the word under the cursor changes, and offering convenient replacement functionality to allow it to stand in stead of Vims z=.

If you have wished there was a slicker, less obtrusive interface than Vims modal full-screen one to spelling suggestions and corrections, unite-spell-suggest is for you.
